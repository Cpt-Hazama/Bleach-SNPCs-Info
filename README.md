# Bleach SNPCs Mod
*Note that information regarding the mod is based on the 1.0 release! Consider this a FAQ!*

A mod almost 3 years in the making, the Bleach SNPCs mod aims to bring a genuine Bleach experience in the world of Garry's Mod, allowing users to enjoy the sandbox aspect of a Bleach setting.

# What's included?

The Bleach mod adds a large roster of characters into Garry's Mod, including many customization/debug settings as well as an entire character info menu! Every character is fully controllable, not just a NPC, each one having their own unique attacks and gimmicks. There is also a custom soundtrack system built into the mod which utilizes tracks from various Bleach video game titles.

As of the 1.0 release of the mod, there will be a total of 40 main characters (including any transformations), many mob enemies and over 25 soundtracks. There are plans for post-release content as well, adding several new characters as well as some crossovers from other anime.

# Where do the original contents come from?

Most of the assets in the mod originate from Bleach Soul Resurrection, with some character models being either custom made or from the various mobile games that have been discontinued. A lot of assets have been enhanced from their original sources as well, to maintain quality in the mod and not just be a swamp of various unmatched assets.

# Is AI used in this mod? Some characters in the mod never debuted in a dubbed Bleach title

No. I will never use AI voice sampling in any of my mods. It's disrespectful to those who have worked so hard in the industry to get to where they are. Any characters that lack an original english dubbed Bleach title have been dubbed over by incredible voice actors that I've hired.

# When will the mod release?

April 26th, 2025!

# What is the gameplay like?

I've spent a long time working on and improving the combat for the Bleach mod, going through various phases of design. Bleach Soul Resurrection's combat was quite lack luster, an acceptable style for a hack'n'slash title. The combat in the mod takes what Bleach Soul Resurrection had, greatly improved upon it, and integrated gameplay mechanics from many popular anime titles. If you've seen the Bleach SNPCs Release Date Trailer and are a Dragon Ball fan, you most likely immediately noticed a familiar mechanic, the 'Vanishing Counter'. I've made sure to keep the combat fluid and flexible, allowing players to create and perform various combo strings not normally possible in other Bleach titles.

Many characters have special gimmicks, indicated by unique icons/gauges on their HUD. Maintaining your spiritual pressure is key to victory, as without it you quickly become an easy victim. By dealing damage to your opponents, you can raise your 'Ignition' meter, which gives you access to enhanced stats and abilities once full and activated. Some characters utilize transformations through their Ignition meter, which completely changes their movesets and stats!

There is also an optional progression system in the mod, which allows players to gain EXP from battling opponents. Raising your level will enhance your stats slowly until you reach the level cap (by default, all characters are max level unless you turn on the progression system). This is to allow a unique experience in combat when having to face enemies who have a higher level than yourself. It also allows players to fight against weaker NPCs that are present within Garry's Mod.

# Bleach Rebirth of Souls...?

Yes... while I am so excited to finally get a Bleach game after all this time, I am also in a bit of a pickle with this one. I spent around 3 years time on this mod because I wanted to give Bleach fans a new experience after all this time, only to be met with an official game out of the blue. While I haven't let the appearance of the title hinder my progress, it has made me feel like my work has been for nothing. Not to mention this is a Bandai Namco publisher title, and knowing Bandai there is always the possibility they could shut my project down since they finally have their eyes on Bleach content again. I'll continue to work on the project, even if it feels like it's been completely over-shadowed at this point.

# Censorship?

No, I have removed any form of censorship on the models.

# I'm a voice actor, and I'm interested in working on this project!

Great! I love to give semi-professional voice actors more roles for their portfollio!

While I can't hire everyone who comes my way, if I have a character available that needs dubbing and your final pricing is reasonable (I'm very flexible, but not rich. Though I have not had any issues with pricing in the past), then I'll happily hire you! The one thing I always tell my VAs is that I don't need you to sound exactly like the character. As long as you can put your heart and soul into your role to bring the character's personality to life, that's all I need.

# Other Questions

I'm always ready to answer questions regarding my projects, so long as they're reasonable! If you have a question regarding the project, you can DM me on Discord @cpt_hazama!
